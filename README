On pressing of F12 key starts the cursor walking to the top and then bottom of the file. Rate sate by updatetime. If it's too slow for you put set ut=1000 somewhere in you vimrc, that will make it walk every second. Press F11 to switch direction. (Simply change the mappings if you'd like to use different keys.)

Works very will with "Changing Colour" script. (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2658). Coding will now never be boring again.
